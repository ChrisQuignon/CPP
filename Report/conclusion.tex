\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This report gave the opportunity to elaborate on the implementation process and inform about the knowledge and experiences gained during the project. Plenty of theoretical considerations and practical skills were required to deploy a software that handels prime numbers, generates two dimensional alignments and excepts patterns within these alignments. As an ancillary effect, the existance of vectors with a visually distinguishable different desity of prime numbers in their alignment on Hilbert- and N curves could be shown.

The complexity of prime numbers produced quite a few challenges, that were faced with methods that holds parts of mathematics and computer science. The correct Cell processor deployment required a lot of accuracy. To exploit the processors architecture it was necessary to handle large data with the use of pointers in C. At this point, the parallel implementation had to be canceled due to the lack of time available. To me, this does not diminish the outcome of the project. This failure lead to an even more precise and sceptical analysis of the design, from which it derived benefits. I am confident, that the reader and I cannot but benefit from the discussed impediments.
